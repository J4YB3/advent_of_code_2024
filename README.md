# Advent of code 2024
This repository contains my solutions and inputs for advent of code 2024.

I decided to use the rust language, because I want to improve my understanding of the language and my knowledge of its syntax.
At the same time it's a modern language low-level that focuses on memory safety and has a rich standard library.
As a consequence of the integrated functionalities, no additional libraries need to be installed.
Its functional coding approach makes it perfect for the advent of code.

In addition, the rust language is a welcome change from my usual web-development work.

## Structure
- `src` contains all source files. It contains files for each day of the event. The tests for each day are included inside each implementation file.
- `inputs` contains my given inputs for the event. Additional test inputs may be included as well.
